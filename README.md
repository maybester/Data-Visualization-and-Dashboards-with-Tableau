# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
>In this project, we will combine and practice implementing what we have learned throughout this course, including:
>
>1. Turning data into easily consumable visual insights, using Tableau
>2. Creating impactful dashboards that help stakeholders make decisions, based on a business questions
>3. Communicating insights with the correct visualizations

## Process
### Step 1: Connecting Data
Download data from [airbnb.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BJWyZpZrrRUla_EQ6Pnusy0KH31UMGf2/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108445376648788204707&rtpof=true&sd=true). Connect the dataset to the Tableau datasource. The dataset contains string, number, and date data type.

### Step 2: Explore the Table

Airbnb of NYC is located mainly in four districts which are Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens. By running a quick table calculation, it can be interpreted that Manhattan has half of the hosts (52.61%), Brooklyn has 38.31% of the hosts, Queens has 7.47% of the hosts and Bronx and staten Island have fewer hosts which are only 1.13% and 0.48% of the total number.
